To develop this package from source:

- check out the software from the repository

- ``cd`` to the checkout

- Ideally with a clean, non-system python, run
  ``python bootstrap/bootstrap.py``

- run ``./bin/buildout``

To run tests, run *both* of the following:

- ``./bin/test``: this tests zc.relation alone

- ``./bin/testall``: this tests zc.relation and zc.relationship, to make sure
  that zc.relation changes do not break zc.relationship tests.

Changes should be documented in CHANGES.txt *in the package*.

Before making a release that registers the software to PyPI, run the following:

- ``./bin/py setup.py``

This then creates a file with the following silly name:
``TEST_THIS_REST_BEFORE_REGISTERING.txt``

As the name suggests, test the file in a ReST tool to make sure docutils
parses it correctly.

Once this works, go ahead and ``./bin/py setup.py sdist register upload``.
